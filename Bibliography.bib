	debate on indexical reference, (CD) has been invoked in arguments
	against the view that intentions determine the semantic content of
	indexicals and demonstratives (intentionalism). In this paper, I
	argue that the interpretations of (CD) that these arguments rely
	on are questionable, and suggest an alternative interpretation, which
	is compatible with (strong) intentionalism. Moreover, I suggest an
	approach that combines elements of intentionalism with other subjectivist
	approaches, and discuss the role of intuitions in developing and
	evaluating theories of indexical reference.}

	indexical contextualism --I unpack these various challenges and consider
	the responses available to the contextualist. The three responses
	I consider are as follows: giving an alternative analysis of the
	concept of disagreement; claiming that speakers suffer from semantic
	blindness; and claiming that attributions of beauty carry presuppositions
	of commonality. I will argue that none of the available strategies
	gives a response which both (a) satisfactorily explains all of the
	disagreement?data and (b) is plausible independent of significant
	evidence in favor of contextualism. I conclude that individualized
	indexical contextualism about the aesthetic is untenable, although

  __markedentry = {[Michael:]},
  abstract = {According to semantic minimalism, context-invariant minimal semantic
	propositions play an essential role in linguistic communication.
	This claim is key to minimalists� argument against semantic contextualism:
	if there were no such minimal semantic propositions, and semantic
	content varied widely with shifts in context, then it would be �miraculous�
	if communication were ever to occur. This paper offers a critical
	examination of the minimalist account of communication, focusing
	on a series of examples where communication occurs without a minimal
	semantic proposition shared between speaker and hearer. The only
	way for minimalists to respond to these examples is by restricting
	the scope of their account to intra-lingual communication. It can
	then be shown (1) that the minimalist�s notion of a language shrinks
	to a point, such that practically no instances of communication will
	fall under that account, and (2) that the retreat to intra-lingual
	communication is in any case self-defeating, since the only way for
	minimalists to account for the individuation of languages is by resort
	to precisely the kinds of contextual considerations they abjured
	in the first place. In short, if, as minimalists allege, contextualism
	founders because it renders communication contingent on speaker and
	hearer sharing a context, it can now be seen that minimalism faces
	a parallel problem because it renders communication contingent on
	speaker and hearer sharing a language. I end by arguing that the
	possibility of communication cannot, as minimalists assume, be grounded
	in shared semantic conventions; rather, successful communication
	must precede the establishment of any particular set of semantic
	conventions.}

	the satisfaction of conditions that the speaker had been concerned
	to get right in making the utterance. However, the debate about assessor?relativism
	about epistemic modals, predicates of taste, gradable adjectives
	and conditionals has been largely driven by cases in which seemingly
	felicitous assessments of utterances are insensitive to aspects of
	the context of utterance that were highly relevant to the speaker?s
	choice of words. In this paper, we offer an explanation of why certain
	locutions invite insensitive assessments, focusing primarily on ?tasty?
	and ?might?. We spell out some reasons why felicitous insensitive
	assessments are puzzling and argue briefly that recent attempts to
	accommodate such assessments (including attempts by John MacFarlane,
	Kai von Fintel and Anthony Gillies) all fail to provide more than
	hints at a solution to the puzzle. In the main part of the paper,
	we develop an account of felicitous insensitive assessments by identifying
	a number of pragmatic factors that influence the felicity of assessments.
	Before closing, we argue that the role of these factors extend beyond
	cases considered in the debate about assessor?relativism and fit
	comfortably with standard contextualist analyses of the relevant
	locutions.}

	intellectualism defended by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson
	(2001) and Berit Brogaard (2007, 2008, 2009), knowledge-how simply
	reduces to knowledge-that. To a first approximation, s knows how
	to A iff there is a w such that s knows that w is a way to A. For
	example, John knows how to ride a bicycle if and only if there is
	a way w such that John knows that w is a way to ride a bicycle. John
	Bengson and Marc Moffett (2007) defend an anti-reductionist version
	of intellectualism which takes knowledge-how to require, in addition,
	that s understand the concepts involved in her belief. According
	to the anti-intellectualist accounts originally defended by Gilbert
	Ryle (1946) and many others after him, knowledge-how requires the
	possession of a practical ability and so knowing that w (for some
	w) is a way to A does not suffice for knowing-how. For example, John
	knows how to ride a bicycle only if John has the ability to ride
	it; if John merely knows that w (for some w) is a way to ride a bicycle,
	John does not know how to ride a bicycle. Here I will argue for a
	conciliatory position that is compatible with the reductionist variety
	of intellectualism: knowledge-how is reducible to knowledge-that.
	But, I argue, there are knowledge states which are not justification-entailing
	and knowledge states which are not belief-entailing. Both kinds of
	knowledge state require the possession of practical abilities. I
	conclude by arguing that the view defended naturally leads to a disjunctive
	conception of abilities as either essentially involving mental states
	or as not essentially involving mental states. Only the former kind
	of ability is a kind of knowledge-state, viz. a knowledge-how state.}

  abstract = {In �Epistemic Modals,� Seth Yalcin argues that what explains the deficiency
	of sentences containing epistemic modals of the form �p and it might
	be that not-p� is that sentences of this sort are strictly contradictory,
	and thus are not instances of a Moore-paradox as has been previous
	suggested. Benjamin Schnieder, however, argues in his Yalcin�s explanation
	of these sentences� deficiency turns out to be insufficiently general,
	as it cannot account for less complex but still defective sentences,
	such as �Suppose it might be raining.� Consequently, Schnieder proposes
	his own, expressivist treatment of epistemic modals which he thinks
	can explain the deficiency of both the original sentence type as
	well as more complex cases of embedded sentences containing epistemic
	modals. In this study, I argue that although Schnieder is right to
	draw our attention to the explanatory failure of Yalcin�s account,
	we aren�t forced to adopt Schnieder�s expressivist account of epistemic
	modals. I defend instead a contextualist-friendly alternative which
	explains the deficiencies of all the relevant sentence types, while
	avoiding both the defects of Yalcin�s account and the intuitive costs
	of expressivism.},

	of standard scientific method with a new name. (For descriptions
	of reflective equilibrium, see Daniels 1979, 1980b, 1984; Goodman
	1965; Rawls 1971.) A theory is constructed to account for a set of
	observations. Recalcitrant data may be rejected as noise or explained
	away as the effects of interference of some sort. Recalcitrant data
	that cannot be plausibly dismissed force emendations in theory. What
	counts as a plausible dismissal depends, among other things, on the
	going theory, as well as on background theory and on knowledge that
	may be relevant to under-standing the experimental design that is
	generating the observations, including knowledge of the apparatus
	and observation conditions. This sort of mutual adjustment between
	theory and data is a familiar feature of scientific practice. Whatever
	authority RE seems to have comes, I think, from a tacit or explicit
	recognition that it has the same form as this familiar sort of scientific
	inference. One way to see the rationale underlying this procedure
	in science is to focus on prediction. Think of prediction as a matter
	of projecting what is known onto uncharted territory. To do this,
	you need a vehicle---{}a theory---{}that captures some invariant
	or pattern in what is known so that you can project it onto the unknown.
	How convincing the projection is depends on two factors: (i) how
	sure one is of the observational base, and (ii) how sure one is that
	the theory gets the invariants right. The two factors are not independent,
	of course. One's confidence in the observational base will be affected
	by how persuasively the theory identifies and dismisses noise; one's
	confidence in the theory, on the other hand, will depend on one's
	confidence in the observations it takes seriously. Prediction is
	important as a $<$span class='Hi'$>$test$<$/span$>$ of theory precisely
	because verified predictions seem to show that the theory has correctly
	captured the general in the particular, that it has got the drift
	of the observational evidence in which our confidence is ultimately
	grounded..}

	RCs are in all central respects based on fallacies and confusions.
	Thus, even if the notion of an RC were one worth defending, it could

	to these revisionaries, such cases show that the canonical story
	needs to be amended in some way that makes multiple bodies of information

	the right canonical, flexibly contextualist account of modals can
	accommodate the full range of challenge cases. The key will be to

	that any adequate dispositional view of color will have to associate
	colors with complex functions from a wide range of normal circumstances
	to a wide range of (simultaneously) incompatible color appearances,
	so that there will be no uniquely veridical appearance of any given
	color. The second is to show that once this move is made, dispositionalism
	is in a position to provide interesting answers to some of the most
	challenging objections that have been pressed against it. It explains
	why colors do not seem to �come on� when the lights come on, and
	why the right thing to say seems to be that the light causes the
	objects to reveal their colors. It explains why the content of visual
	experience need not be problematically circular. It eliminates the
	problem of intrapersonal variation in color appearance. And it even
	provides resources for dealing with the problem of interpersonal
	variation. It is true that in moving to the more complex view, the
	dispositionalist becomes subject to a new objection, which has been
	called �the problem of unity.� The paper offers a solution to this
	problem as well.},

	pivotal to this conception are truth, truth-condition, sense and
	force, naming and describing (representation), and theory of meaning
	for natural languages. The alternative conception is an anthropological
	one, which conceives of language above all as a form of human communicative
	behaviour, constituted by human practices and manifest in human action.
	The notions pivotal to this conception are practice, language-game,
	use and rule of use as given by explanations of meaning, understanding
	and criteria of understanding. The fundamental principles that inform

	Such a case would be one in which it was indeterminate whether a=b

	The interest of the argument lies, in part, in the fact that it appears
	to appeal to none of the controversial claims to which similar arguments
	due to Gareth Evans and Nathan Salmon appeal. I argue for two counter-claims.
	First, the formal argument fails to establish its conclusion, for
	essentially the same reason Evans's and Salmon's arguments fail to
	establish their conclusions. Second, the phenomena in which Pinillos
	is interested, which concern the cardinalities of sets of vague objects,
	manifest the existence of what Kit Fine called `penumbral connections',

	and sentences are structured objects. One obvious question to ask
	about such a view is whether there is any interesting connection
	between these two sorts of structure. The author identifies two theses
	about this relationship. Identity (ID) -- the structure of a sentence
	and the proposition it expresses are identical. Determinism (DET)
	-- the structure of a sentence determines the structure of the proposition
	it expresses. After noting that ID entails DET, the author argues
	against DET (and therefore also against ID). This argument is based
	on considerations to do with unarticulated constituents, but it is
	not ultimately empirical. As well as answering a question suggested
	by contemporary theories of propositions, the conclusion is significant
	because some, but not all, of the theories of propositions currently
	popular entail ID and/or DET. Unless there is a response to the argument
	here, those theories are refuted.}

	boundary between the brain and its environment. This boundary defines
	the mind-world relation, opens the door to skepticism, and makes
	the mind transpire as more inferentially secluded and neurocentrically

	derived from orderings on worlds in the tradition of Kratzer (1991).
	All of these semantics avoid the entailment problems that result

	order fragment of $<$span class='Hi'$>$Discourse$<$/span$>$ Representation
	Theory. Since the inferences that human language users draw from
	the verbal input they receive for the most transcend the capacities
	of such a system, it can be no more than a basis on which more powerful
	systems, which are capable of producing those inferences, may then
	be built. Nevertheless, even within the general setting of first
	order logic the structure of the formulas of DRS-languages, i.e.
	of the $<$span class='Hi'$>$Discourse$<$/span$>$ Representation Structures
	suggest for the components of such a system inference rules that
	differ somewhat from those usually found in proof systems for the
	first order predicate calculus and which are, we believe, more in
	keeping with inference patterns that are actually employed in common
	sense reasoning.This is why we have decided to publish the present
	exercise, in spite of the fact that it is not one for which a great
	deal of originality could be claimed. In fact, it could be argued
	that the problem addressed in this paper was solved when G\"o{}del
	first established the completeness of the system of Principia Mathematica
	for first order logic. For the DRS-languages we consider here are
	straightforwardly intertranslatable with standard formulations of
	the predicate calculus; in fact the translations are so straightforward
	that any sound and complete proof system for first order logic can
	be used as a sound and complete proof system for DRSs: simply translate
	the DRSs into formulas of predicate logic and then proceed as usual.
	As a matter of fact, this is how one has chosen to proceed in some
	implementations of DRT, which involve inferencing as well as semantic
	representation; an example is the Lex system developed jointly by
	IBM and the University of T\"u{}bingen (see in particular (Guenthner
	et al. 1986)).}

	refute Russell\textquoteright{}s theory (or Strawson\textquoteright{}s)?
	For definiteness, I will concentrate on Donnellan versus Russell,
	leaving Strawson aside. And about this issue I will draw a definite
	conclusion, one which I think will illuminate a few methodological
	maxims about language. Namely, I will conclude that the considerations
	in Donnellan\textquoteright{}s paper, by themselves, do not refute
	Russell\textquoteright{}s theory. Any conclusions about Russell\textquoteright{}s
	views per se, or Donnellan\textquoteright{}s, must be tentative,
	IfI were to be asked for a tentative stab about Russell, I would
	say that although his theory does a far better job of handling ordinary
	discourse than many have thought, and although many popular arguments
	against it are inconclusive, probably it ultimately fails. The considerations
	I have in mind have to do with the existence of \textquotedblleft{}improper\textquotedblright
	definite descriptions, such as \textquotedblleft{}the table," where
	uniquely specifying conditions are not contained in the description
	itself..}

	aware of herself as the focal center of a caregiver's attending.
	Yet that does not account for her awareness of herself as agent.
	To address this question, I bring in research on neonatal imitation,
	as well as studies demonstrating the existence of a neural system
	in which parts of the same brain areas are activated when observing
	another's action and when executing a similar one. Applying these
	findings, I consider gestural exchanges between infant and caregiver,
	such as reciprocal smiles and imitative vocalizations. Lacking self-awareness
	at first, the infant is unaware of her own agency. By returning her
	unwitting gesture, the caregiver singles out for her�thanks to neural
	matching�the gesture's kinesthesis. Moreover, the caregiver's smile,
	imitative vocalization, or other gesture is the form that focusing
	takes. The kinesthesis of the infant's gesture, in being singled
	out, is experienced by the infant as what the caregiver is focusing
	on. It is experienced as being within the focal center. In this way,
	the infant becomes aware of herself as a bodily entity acting toward
	the caregiver. Exchanges that involve matching are at first essential,
	I argue, in making the infant present to herself in action. Matching
	will cease to be necessary, but self-awareness continues to depend
	fundamentally on others until the acquisition of language, when the
	child becomes capable of talking to herself as if she were the caregiver.}

	it. Saying I have such a rule invites the interpretation that it is

	the question why such conceptions are nevertheless currently prevailing

	the notion of explanation, to conceptions about which mental phenomena

	in the wake of behavioristic conceptions, to a bias favoring investigations
	of input--{}output relations at the expense of enquiries into internal

	adhere to these tacit assumptions, they are prone to turn into a
	largely a-theoretical and data-driven endeavor while at the same

	objective representationalism, experiences represent only objective
	(i.e. suitably mind-independent) properties. I explore subjective

	some subjective (i.e. suitably mind-dependent) properties. Subjective
	representationalists, but not objective representationalists, can

	the most natural view is that we hear a speaker�s utterance
	
	and infer what was said, drawing on our competence in
	
	the syntax and semantics of the language. An alternative view
	
	that has emerged in the literature is that native speakers have a
	
	non-inferential capacity to perceive the content of speech. Call
	
	this the perceptual view. The disagreement here is best understood
	
	as an epistemological one about whether our knowledge
	
	of what speakers say is epistemically mediated by our linguistic
	
	competence. The present paper takes up the question of how we
	
	should go about settling this issue. Arguments for the perceptual
	
	view generally appeal to the phenomenology of speech comprehension.
	
	The present paper develops a line of argument for the
	
	perceptual view that draws on evidence from empirical psychology.
	
	The evidence suggests that a speaker�s core syntactic and semantic
	
	competence is typically deployed sub-personally (e.g., by
	
	something like a module). The point is not just that the competence
	
	is tacit or unconscious, but that the person is not the locus
	
	of the competence. I argue that standing competence can enter
	
	into the grounds for knowledge only if it is subject to a certain
	
	sort of epistemic assessment, an assessment that is appropriate
	
	only if the person is the locus of that competence. If the person
	
	is not the locus of a speaker�s core linguistic competence, as the
	
	psychological evidence suggests, then that competence does not
	
	enter into the grounds for our knowledge of what speakers say.
	
	If this line of argument is right, it has implications for the epistemology
	
	of perception and for our understanding of how empirical
	
	psychology bears on epistemology generally.},

	aim is to defend the view that we can directly perceive ordinary
	objects, such as cups, keys and the like.1 The book is organized
	around the two arguments that Smith considers to be serious threats
	to the possibility of direct perception: the argument from illusion,
	and the argument from hallucination. The argument from illusion threatens
	this possibility because it concludes that indirect realism is true.
	Indirect realism is the view that we perceive mind-independent ordinary
	objects, but can only do so indirectly, by perceiving mind-dependent
	objects: objects whose existence depends on being perceived or thought
	about. The argument from hallucination draws a similar conclusion:
	if we perceive mindindependent ordinary objects at all, then our
	perception of them is indirect in the same way. In responding to
	these arguments, Smith develops an account of percep- tual consciousness.
	Perceptual consciousness is a kind of experience, distinct from what
	Smith calls \textquoteleft{}mere sensory experiences\textquoteright,
	or equivalently, \textquoteleft{}mere sensation\textquoteright. Perceptual
	consciousness is experience that is properly percep- tual, in which
	one has the phenomenology of perceiving things in the external world
	(including one\textquoteright{}s body) that exist independently of
	one\textquoteright{}s mind. Perceptual consciousness on its own does
	not suffice for actually being in perceptual contact with mind-independent
	reality, although it suffices for it to seem as if one i s . It follows
	that perceptual consciousness does not suffice for direct perception
	of ordinary objects, or for direct realism. Nevertheless, Smith holds
	that the correct account of perceptual consciousness is a crucial
	element in blocking the arguments from illusion and hallucination,
	and therefore in supporting the possibility of direct perception.
	This is an extraordinarily engaging book. Within a single, unified
	narrative, one encounters the views of many philosophers---{}Husserl,
	Fine, Broad, Sextus Empiricus, Loar, Schopenhauer, Meinong, Burge,
	Dilthey, Russell, Dennett, Sartre, O\textquoteright{}Shaughnessy,

  journal = {Journal of Semantics},
  year = {forthcoming},
  pages = {-},
  abstract = {This article presents a formal semantic analysis of the Bulgarian
	evidential. The analysis is motivated by a number of facts that have
	gone unnoticed in the literature on evidentiality in Bulgarian and
	which cannot be explained by previous analyses (Izvorski 1997; Sauerland
	& Schenner 2007; Koev 2011). First, I show that the same evidential
	construction in Bulgarian can express direct, reportative and inferential
	information sources. These data challenge the current analysis of
	the Bulgarian evidential as indirect (Izvorski 1997), and show that
	in some languages a single evidential morpheme can express both direct
	and indirect information sources (contra Willett 1988; Aikhenvald
	2004). Second, I show that the Bulgarian evidential expresses temporal
	meaning: it functions as a relative tense. Finally, while I retain
	the insights of Izvorski's modal analysis, I substantially change
	the modal component to account for reports of false information in
	reportative contexts (I analyze them as de dicto reports). Ultimately,
	I argue that the evidential construction in Bulgarian has a tripartite
	meaning: it encodes information source, temporality and epistemic
	modality. This article contributes to the understanding of the semantics
	of evidentials cross-linguistically (cf. Faller 2002; McCready &
	Ogata 2007; Matthewson et al. 2007) by showing how the interaction
	of the modal and the temporal component affects the distribution
	and meaning of evidentials in discourse.}

	theory of speech acts advanced by Austin and Searle. It is designed
	to do justice to the ways in which documents can be used to bring
	about a variety of effects in virtue of the fact that, where speech
	is evanescent, documents are continuant entities. This means that
	documents can be preserved in such a way that they can be inspected
	and modified at successive points in time and grouped together into
	enduring document complexes. We outline some components of a theory
	of document acts, and show how it can throw light on certain problems

  abstract = {Standard contextualism regarding epistemic modality is a family of
	theories that state that the modal base of an epistemic is determined
	solely by the context of utterance and the evaluation world. Recently
	it has been argued that standard contextualism is untenable because
	it cannot account for dialogues featuring (dis)agreement with epistemic
	claims and for the semantic import of epistemics embedded under attitude
	verbs. I present a new variant of standard contextualism, Practical
	Contextualism, which successfully accounts for both kinds of phenomena,
	and in some cases makes better predictions than its current non-standard-contextualist
	competitors.},
